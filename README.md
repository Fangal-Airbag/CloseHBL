# CloseHBL

This is a really simple app, it quits the Homebrew Launcher and opens the Wii U home menu. It's surprisingly convenient though :P

Special thanks to TheLegendOfXela for the icon!

## Building

To build this make sure you have `devkitPro`, `devkitPPC` and `wut` installed via the dkp-pacman package manager. Then just run `make` in the same directory as the Makefile and use the resulting rpx.
